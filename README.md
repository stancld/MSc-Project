**Description:** The aim of this industry-based project, conducted in a cooperation with Fidelity International, is to create a regularly refreshed database (implemented in Django) containing employee reviews listed on Glassdoor.com (scraped with Selenium). Subsequently, the sentiment of the reviews are to be scored with pre-trained language models and the results are to be incorporated into the multi-factor credit scoring model as a part of ESG investing framework.
